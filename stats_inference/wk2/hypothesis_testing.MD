let's learn hypothesis testing!

H_0 = NULL hypothesis, represents the status quo and is assumed true

test:

mu = 30

  alternative
  
mu > 30

sqrt(n) * (X' - mu) / s > Z_{1-alpha} #general rule for rejection


(X'-mu) / (s/sqrt(n)) = test statistic = the number of estimated std errors between the sample and hypothesized means
