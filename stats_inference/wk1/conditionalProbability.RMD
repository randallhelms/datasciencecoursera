D = patient has hiv
+ = positive result
- = negative result

0.001 = prevalence
0.997 =  + result with disease
0.985 = - result with disease

P(+ | D) * P(D)

p(D) = 0.001

p(+ | D)

((0.997 * 0.001) / (0.001)) * 0.001

((+ * D) / D) * D

---

P(+|~D)*P(~D)

(1-.985)*(1-.001)

| Now put the pieces together to compute the probability 
| that the patient has the
| disease given his positive test result,
| P(D|+). Plug your last two answers into the
| formula P(+|D) * P(D) / ( P(+|D) * P(D) +
| P(+|~D) * P(~D) ) to compute P(D|+).

P(+|D) * P(D) = 0.000997
P(+|~D) * P(~D) = 0.014985

0.000997 / (0.000997 + 0.014985)

| The diagnostic likelihood ratio of a positive test, DLR_+, is the ratio of
| the two + conditional probabilities, one given the presence of disease and
| the other given the absence. Specifically, DLR_+ = P(+|D) / P(+|~D).
| Similarly, the DLR_- is defined as a ratio. Which of the following do you
| think represents the DLR_-?

P(-|D) / P(-|~D)

Expected values are properties of distributions

A population mean is a center of mass of a population

A sample mean is a center of mass of observed data

A population mean estimates a sample mean? False

a sample mean is unbiased

The more data in a sample mean, the more concentrated its density/mass function
